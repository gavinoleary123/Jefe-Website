    <p class="cushycms" data-cms-field="about_text">
      Inspired by my journeys around the world during my Marine Corps days, Jefes Barbershop was born from a vision—a blend of global modernity and classic barbering tradition. I traveled far and wide, immersing myself in the diverse styles of modern and timeless barbershops, and from that mosaic, our concept emerged.
      <br><br>
      Imagine stepping into a classic gentlemen’s barbershop that whispers of history while showcasing a modern twist in every detail. Our space is designed with meticulous attention to traditional services: whether it’s a precision haircut, an artful beard trim, or a flawless straight razor neck shave, every service begins with a thoughtful consultation.
      <br><br>
      We elevate the experience with complimentary drinks, carefully curated music, and sports on our TVs—creating an atmosphere that’s both refined and welcoming. And in honor of our roots, we proudly offer exclusive discounts for military, first responders, and teachers.
      <br><br>
      Conveniently located within a 15-minute drive from Benbrook, Aledo, Weatherford, White Settlement, Eagle Mountain, and North/South/West Fort Worth, we invite you to experience a place where tradition meets modernity and every detail is crafted to earn and keep your trust.
      <br><br>
      Give us a chance, and we’ll deliver the best cut, the best shave, and an unforgettable experience.

            I’ve had the opportunity to visit many Barbershops, living in the East Coast, Mid-West, South and Westcoast. No matter what I had going on, leaving a quality Barbershop with a clean cut always put a smile on my face and my confidence was through the roof. That’s my goal as an Owner/Barber – to ensure you look and feel good when you leave our shop. My mission is to bring back a bit of that nostalgic vibe within our doors and I will always try to go above and beyond to earn and keep your business.

            I was introduced to the barber community as a receptionist seven years ago, working on and off for about five years.

I take pride in asking the right questions to understand exactly what each client desires, and it brings me joy to help others achieve their best look.
