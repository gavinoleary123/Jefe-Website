      <p class="cushycms" data-cms-field="about_text">
        “Jefes Barbershop came from an idea formed many years ago throughout my travels around the world while in the Marine Corps. Everything from modern to classic types of Barbershops is what gave us a foundation as to what a shop should look and feel like. This is our interpretation, a classic gentlemen’s Barbershop with a modern twist. The one thing that was non-negotiable when creating our concept was traditional services. We offer traditional haircuts, modern haircuts along with your beard and shaving needs. All our services include a thorough consultation and a straight razor neck shave. Complimentary drinks, music and sports on the TVs will always be available to our clients. With much appreciation we also offer a military, first responder and teacher discount. Jefes humbly and proudly serves anyone that is willing to walk through our doors, we are conveniently located approximately 15 minutes or less from Benbrook, Aledo, Weatherford, White Settlement, Eagle Mountain area and North/South/West Fort Worth. Give us a chance and we will give you our best to earn and keep your business.”

            I’ve had the opportunity to visit many Barbershops, living in the East Coast, Mid-West, South and Westcoast. No matter what I had going on, leaving a quality Barbershop with a clean cut always put a smile on my face and my confidence was through the roof. That’s my goal as an Owner/Barber – to ensure you look and feel good when you leave our shop. My mission is to bring back a bit of that nostalgic vibe within our doors and I will always try to go above and beyond to earn and keep your business.

            I was introduced to the barber community as a receptionist seven years ago, working on and off for about five years. This experience ignited my passion for barbering and inspired me to pursue it as a career.

I take pride in asking the right questions to understand exactly what each client desires, and it brings me joy to help others achieve their best look.
